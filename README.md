## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it are governed by the [XMiDT Code Of Conduct](https://xmidt.io/code_of_conduct/).
By participating, you agree to this Code.

## Details
argus has one function: interact with a database whether it is internal or external.
To enable this, argus has two endpoints: 1) individual items, and 2) buckets containing items.

### Create Individual Item - `store/{bucket}/{uuid}` endpoint
This endpoint allows for clients to `PUT` an object into argus.  The placeholder variables in the path must contain:

* _bucket_ - The name used to indicate the resource type of which the stored data represents.  A plural form of a noun word should be used for stylistic reasons.
* _uuid_ - The unique ID within the name space of the containing bucket.  It is recommended this value is the resulting value of a SHA256 calculation, using the unique attributes of the object being represented (e.g. `SHA256(<identifier>)`).  This will be used by argus to determine uniqueness of objects being stored or updated.


The body must be in JSON format with the following attributes:

* _uuid_ - Required.  See above.
* _identifier_ - Required.  Common name of the provided resource.  There is no enforcement of uniqueness across resource of this type.
* _data_ - Required.  RAW JSON to be stored.  Opaque to argus.
* _owner_ - Optional.  Free form string to identify the owner of this object.
* _ttl_ - Optional.  Specified in units of seconds.  Defaults to 0 if omitted, which means this object will not auto expire.

An optional header `X-Midt-Owner` can be sent to associate the object with an owner.  The value of this header will be bound to a new record, which would require the same value passed in a `X-Midt-Owner` header for subsequent reads or modifications.  This in effect creates a secret attribute bound to the life of newly created records. 

For cases when an existing item needs to be updated on behalf of another unknown owner, `X-Midt-Admin-Token` allows passing a secret key to allow such operation. Note that when updating such item, `X-Midt-Owner` is ignored and the owner of the updated item is unchanged. 

An example PUT request
```
PUT /store/planets/7e8c5f378b4addbaebc70897c4478cca06009e3e360208ebd073dbee4b3774e7
```
```json
{
  "uuid": "7e8c5f378b4addbaebc70897c4478cca06009e3e360208ebd073dbee4b3774e7",
  "identifier" : "earth",
  "data": {
    "year":  1967,
     "words": ["What", "a", "Wonderful", "World"]
  },
  "ttl" : 300
}
```

Example responses:
```
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
```
The above response would indicate a new object has been created (no existing object with the given UUID was found).

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
```
The above response would indicate an existing object has been updated (existing object with the given UUID was found).  Note that a PUT operation on an existing record may also result in "403 Forbidden" error.


### List - `store/{bucket}` endpoint
This endpoint allows for `GET` to retrieve all the items in the bucket organized by the id.

An example response will look like where "earth" is the id of the item. An optional header `X-Midt-Owner` can be sent with the request.  If supplied, only items with secrets matching the supplied value will be returned in the list. If items from all owners are desired, use the `X-Midt-Admin-Token` header. 

An example response:
```json
[
  {
    "uuid": "7e8c5f378b4addbaebc70897c4478cca06009e3e360208ebd073dbee4b3774e7",
    "identifier": "earth",
    "data": {
      "words": [
        "What",
        "a",
        "Wonderful",
        "World"
      ],
      "year": 1967
    },
    "ttl": 255
  }
]
```


### Individual Item - `store/{bucket}/{uuid}` endpoint
This endpoint allows for `GET`, and `DELETE` REST methods to interact with any object that was created with the previous `PUT` request.  An optional header `X-Midt-Owner` can be sent with the request.  All requests are validated by comparing the secret stored with the requested record with the value sent in the `X-Midt-Owner` header.  If the header is missing, `nil` is assigned to comparison value.  A mismatch will result in a "403 Forbidden" error. For cases where the item's owner is not known, the operation can proceed by using the `X-Midt-Admin-Token`.

An example response:
```json
{
  "uuid": "7e8c5f378b4addbaebc70897c4478cca06009e3e360208ebd073dbee4b3774e7",
  "identifier": "earth",
  "data": {
    "words": [
      "What",
      "a",
      "Wonderful",
      "World"
    ],
    "year": 1967
  },
  "ttl": 100
}
```


## Build

### Source

In order to build from the source, you need a working Go environment with
version 1.11 or greater. Find more information on the [Go website](https://golang.org/doc/install).

You can directly use `go get` to put the argus binary into your `GOPATH`:
```bash
go get github.com/xmidt-org/argus
```

You can also clone the repository yourself and build using make:

```bash
mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/xmidt-org
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/xmidt-org
git clone git@github.com:xmidt-org/argus.git
cd argus
make build
```

### Makefile

The Makefile has the following options you may find helpful:
* `make build`: builds the argus binary
* `make docker`: fetches all dependencies from source and builds an argus
   docker image
* `make local-docker`: vendors dependencies and builds an argus docker image
   (recommended for local testing)
* `make test`: runs unit tests with coverage for argus
* `make clean`: deletes previously-built binaries and object files

### RPM

First have a local clone of the source and go into the root directory of the
repository.  Then use rpkg to build the rpm:
```bash
rpkg srpm --spec <repo location>/<spec file location in repo>
rpkg -C <repo location>/.config/rpkg.conf sources --outdir <repo location>'
```

### Docker

The docker image can be built either with the Makefile or by running a docker
command.  Either option requires first getting the source code.

See [Makefile](#Makefile) on specifics of how to build the image that way.

If you'd like to build it without make, follow these instructions based on your use case:

- Local testing
```bash
go mod vendor
docker build -t argus:local -f deploy/Dockerfile .
```
This allows you to test local changes to a dependency. For example, you can build
a argus image with the changes to an upcoming changes to [webpa-common](https://github.com/xmidt-org/webpa-common) by using the [replace](https://golang.org/ref/mod#go) directive in your go.mod file like so:
```
replace github.com/xmidt-org/webpa-common v1.10.2-0.20200604164000-f07406b4eb63 => ../webpa-common
```
**Note:** if you omit `go mod vendor`, your build will fail as the path `../webpa-common` does not exist on the builder container.

- Building a specific version
```bash
git checkout v0.3.6
docker build -t argus:v0.3.6 -f deploy/Dockerfile .
```

**Additional Info:** If you'd like to stand up a XMiDT docker-compose cluster, read [this](https://github.com/xmidt-org/xmidt/blob/master/deploy/docker-compose/README.md).

### Kubernetes

A helm chart can be used to deploy argus to kubernetes
```
helm install xmidt-argus deploy/helm/argus
```

## Deploy

For deploying a XMiDT cluster refer to [getting started](https://xmidt.io/docs/operating/getting_started/).

For running locally, ensure you have the binary [built](#Source).  If it's in
your `GOPATH`, run:
```
argus
```
If the binary is in your current folder, run:
```
./argus
```
