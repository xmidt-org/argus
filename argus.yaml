    # accessLevel defines config around the injection of an attribute to bascule tokens
    # which application code can leverage to decide if a given request is allowed to execute some operation.
    # Note that accessLevel differs from capabilityCheck in that it allows more complex access hierarchy. 
    # That is, while capabilityCheck verifies whether a user is allowed to use an API endpoint, accessLevel 
    # assigns a number to the user's request which application code can use for security purposes.
    # An access level is defined as a non-negative number and the higher the number, the higher the access the 
    # request has for the target application.
    # (Optional). If section is not provided, the lowest access level value of 0 will be assigned to the attribute.

      # attributeKey is the key that application code can use to fetch the access level from the provided bascule token.
      # (Optional) defaults to 'access-level'
      attributeKey: access-level

      # capabilitySource provides configuration to the component which generates the access level for an incoming request
      # based on its endpoint capabilities. This component assigns only two access levels: 1 for elevated access and 0 otherwise.
      # Components that assign more than two values might be added in the future.
      # (Optional)
      capabilitySource:
        # name is the capability we will search for inside the capability list pointed by path.
        # If this value is found in the list, the access level assigned to the request will be 1. Otherwise, it will be 0.

    # # are checked but the request isn't rejected when there isn't a valid capability 
    # # for the request. Instead, a message is logged.  When "enforce" is provided, a 
    # # request that doesn't have the needed capability is rejected.
    
    # # The capability is expected to have the format:
    
    # # {prefix}{endpoint}:{method}
    
    # # The prefix can be a regular expression.  If it's empty, no capability check
    # # is done.  The endpoint is a regular expression that should match the endpoint
    # # the request was sent to. The method is usually the method of the request, such as
    # # GET.  The accept all method is a catchall string that indicates the capability
    # # is approved for all methods.
